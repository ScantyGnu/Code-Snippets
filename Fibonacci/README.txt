Fibonacci
This is a small piece of code that takes 2 numbers from the user and checks if they are two
consecutive numbers from the Fibonacci Series. It does this by calculating the actual series
and checking the result against the user input. When the numbers are valid it returns the 
sequence, otherwise it returns an error. I could improve this code by making it work with any 
numbers from the series. I thought this would be a fun challenge to test my problem solving 
skills.
