Dragon Slayer
This is a small game where you can traverse a grid to fight monsters and eventually
a dragon. i utilized a lot of text files to quickly modify the images in the game so
the folder is a bit cluttered but i think it was worth it. I also thought it would be 
a good idea to make the movement system dynamic to introduce the smallest amount of 
engagement but everyone that tried it was frustrated, so i would definitely change
that. Another idea i had for improving it was to allow for bigger dungeons and a better
system for weapons and armor.
