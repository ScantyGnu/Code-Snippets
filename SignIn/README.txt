SignIn
This program emulates the experience of signing up for a service: it asks for your password 
and checks it for safety, it checks that your email is valid (for the most part) and it
checks if you qualify for a student discount. It then saves your data and allows you to log
in to your account. It could have better ways of verifying your email as well as more 
functionality but it is just a fun exercise to train my problem solving abilities.
