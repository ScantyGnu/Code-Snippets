Family, tragedy, sorrow, heart, and healing: The TvN/Netflix drama Hi Bye, Mama! has it all wrapped up in a heartwarming comedy-drama that asks the question of what would happen if a loved one came back to life to regain their place amongst their family and friends.
Hi Bye, Mama! tells the story of Cha Yu-Ri (Kim Tae-Hee), a young woman who died prior to the birth of her daughter, Seo-Woo (Seo Woo-Jin).
In the five years since her death, Yu-Ri has watched her daughter grow while lingering around her family including husband Jo Kang-Hwa (Lee Kyu-Hyung) and his new wife, Oh Min-Jung (Go Bo-Gyeol).
When Yu-Ri is set to face judgment and finally cross over, the gods hear her tearful plea to let her stick around by gifting her with 49 days of life with a chance of being human again if she regains her position in her family.
The story holds an interesting premise that is enough to draw in an audience.
A look into the afterlife and the imagination behind what people may think happens on the other side always provides solid storylines that pack an emotional punch, and Hi Bye, Mama!” does just that.
The audience has a chance to put themselves in Yu-Ri’s place as she navigates trying to help her daughter chase away the ghosts that haunt her while trying to, unsuccessfully, stay hidden from her friends and family.
