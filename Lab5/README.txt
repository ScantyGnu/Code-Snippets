Lab 5
This is a compilation of miscelaneous methods:
isPalindrome - checks if a string is a palindrome using a for loop.
lineCounter - Counts the lines on a given textfile.
numOfOcurrences - Counts the instances of a target in a given file.
areaOfCylinder - Calculates the area of a cylinder.
addTxt - Adds .txt to the end of a string if it doesnt have it already.
This is a training exercise.

The countlines.txt file is included for testing.
