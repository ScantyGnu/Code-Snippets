SalamahMarket
This is a small program that simulates an interactive shop, in it you have the option to:
- Add things to your cart (Based on the included database.txt file)
- View your cart
- Clear your cart
- Check out
- Exit
This is an interesting case as it utilizes the included database.txt file to calculate the 
available fruits as well as the prices.
