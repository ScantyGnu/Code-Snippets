ConsecutiveNumbers
This is a small program that will identify if an array has 2 consecutive elements with a 
value of 100. It utilizes recursion to travel along the array and compare the next 2 elements
to see if they are 100. In the code i have two example arrays, one true and one false.
There are a few improvements i could easily make, like including an option for user input as
well as making the target number a variant for more versatility.
This program serves no real purpose other than as a training exercise.
