This is a compilation of miscelaneous methods:
isPalindrome - Checks if a word is a palindrome by checking both ends against eachother
recursively.
isVowel - Checks if the character is a vowel.
vowelCounter - Counts how many vowels are in a string recursively using the isVowel method
frequency - Checks how many instances of our target are found in a string recursively.
oddSumRange - Adds the odd numbers in a range recursively.
reverse - reverses a string recursively
All of this just to train.
